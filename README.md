# ***Hack-A-Thon***

With the data collected with your team from the Fantasy Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Hack-a-thon or other cryptocurrency data, produce 4 animated plots. All of your axes, titles, subtitles, and captions must be labeled and all of the visualizations must be colorful and easy to read. Embed each of your visualizations with a label (fig 1, fig 2) here in the discussion as a post. I suggest uploading your image and select Embed Image from the options above. Underneath each visualization, describe in two complete sentences, what the visualization means and why it is important.
